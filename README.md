This repository is linked to the article "FISTA restart using an automatic estimation of the growth parameter" by J-F. Aujol, C. Dossal, H. Labarri√®re and A. Rondepierre. It can be found at https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03153525.

Numerical_experiments_LS.ipynb and Numerical_experiments_Inpainting.ipynb are the codes from which were provided the figures of the paper. 
Performance_test_inpainting.ipynb is a numerical comparison of different FISTA restart schemes in terms of computation time.
